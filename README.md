# Arduino Light String Project

## Description

This Arduino project creates a customizable light string using LEDs controlled by an Arduino board. The light string offers various lighting modes, including blinking patterns, walking sequences, and more. Users can switch between modes by pressing a button connected to the Arduino board. The code is designed to be easily configurable, allowing for the creation of different festive lighting effects.

## Components Used

- Arduino Board
- LEDs (Total of 11)
- Button (Connected to pin 2)
- Resistors (as needed)
- Jumper Wires

## Setup

1. Connect the LEDs to the designated pins on the Arduino board.
2. Connect the button to pin 2 on the Arduino board.
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board.
4. Power up the Arduino board.
